## [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

My framework of choice to build modern cross-platform mobile apps. You can deploy these apps to Play Store (for Android) and App Store (for iOS).

I follow a test-driven standard for building Flutter apps. I.e, I write (failing) tests first, then I implement functionality based on the tests.

The process of building, testing, and deploying (to stores) can all be automated. You will not need to worry about the tedious administration and configuration that goes behind all that.
