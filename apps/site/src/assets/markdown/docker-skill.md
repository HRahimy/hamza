## [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You cannot have the CI/CD these days without Docker. It makes it easy and in many cases even possible to take your tech stack anywhere and expect it to run.

I simply configure all the dependencies that an application needs to run, and the docker engine ensures it exists when you load and run an image.

## Works and References

In all my projects, I use Dockerfiles to generate container images for running backend applications.
